# Fosta

A raspbery pi based security cam, that alarms, when post arrives. 

## 1 Plot

There is a hungarian post type, that is "in hand" (aj√°nlott). Those cannot land into the postbox, but into the recipient's hands only. Postmen do not necessarily use the doorbell and wait for you. They have a built in doorbell: car horn. So they show up, horn, and if you happen to show up immediately you might get your letter.

If not, the postman writes a notification that letter could not be delivered, therefore you are welcome in the following two weeks at the post office on the other half of the city in worktime.

## 2 Setup

For convenience I have a custom built postbox with plexi doors, so you do not have to open it, to see if you have mail. I have installed a Raspberry Pi with camera to watch it.

## 3 How it works

1. The Raspberry Pi takes a photo every X seconds (set in config file)

2. Photo is rotated

3. Photo is cropped (ROI is just a 45 x 38 pixel area)

4.  Photo converted to grayscale

5.  Variance is calculated on the pixel values

6.  If variance value is above limit, it sends an email

7.  Jump to step 1

### 3.1 Support files
1. Folder: IMG - saved images are stored here.
2. Folder: resources - Git support files are here (images for demonstration, not used by the script)
3. BWC.py - Main script. 
4. BWC_log.txt - a logfile for  application start timestamps
5. config.ini - file to change script behavior, like ROI pixel coordinates, detection variance limit, check frequency in seconds. 
6. credentials.yml - confog file for mail sending setup
7. sendagmail.py - gmail sending handler

## 5 Further use: Security cam

This project was based on [BWC](https://github.com/gitusercz/BWC), which was a webserver with periodically updating image. Fosta was built on top of this. Practically, a webserver is set up and the displayed HTML is edited upon each iteration.

## 6. Notes

### 6.1 On "Variance"

When I was looking for a statistical value that represents that "there is something" on the picture I was browsing through numpy possibilities. According to wikipedia, variance seemed a good candidate. After trying out different pre-saved imagess, it turned out to be a working one. 
[Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)  is a measure of [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion"), meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.

### 6.2 On "Fosta"
This is a name coined by a frustrated SW developer earlier. He created a website to log end user complaints for the faulty work of the Hungarian Post.
